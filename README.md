# Quiz Log Evaluator
The Quiz Log Evaluator is a series of files that include a parser and various evaluation scripts that process multiple XML data files that contained information from submitted answers on a quiz. Created for a university software development course, each test data file contains the submitted answers of one unique student. The evaluation scripts listed on the command line are then compiled to find:

  - The average mark per question for all XML files called (quiz_marks.py)
  - The pass ratio per question for all XML files called (quiz_pass_ratio.py)
  - The average time to complete each question for all XML files called (quiz_time.py)
